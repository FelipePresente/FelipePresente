## Hey there! 👋

I'm Felipe Presente, a computer science student based in Brazil.  
I enjoy building things and turning ideas into code.

My main tech stack includes JavaScript, Node.js, and Tailwind CSS.  
All I need is VS Code and a few hours to bring ideas to life.

Currently, I'm developing a web application called Baixaki2 **[Baixaki2](https://github.com/FelipePresente/Baixaki2)**.
